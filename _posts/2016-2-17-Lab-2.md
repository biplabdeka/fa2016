1 - Open the terminal and point it to the `vagrant-dev` folder from MP 1.

2 - Fire up vagrant and ssh into it. Change directories to `\vagrant`.

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
```

3 -  Go to your github account (or create one) and create a new repository named `mp2`. ***Set it to private*** (you'll have to activate the [Github student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to be able to create private repos. The other option is to use [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)). [Create a duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) of the [MP-2 starter code](https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp2_starter) from the class github repo by using the commands below

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp2_starter.git
cd mp2_starter.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/your-github-username/mp2.git
# Mirror-push to your mp2 repository. Use your github username in the URL. Change the URL if you're using bitbucket.
cd ..
rm -rf mp2_starter.git
```
Then clone it to your machine and inspect the files inside by using the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/mp2
cd mp2
```

4 - Install the necessary npm and bower modules, uglify the Javascript, compile the scss files and finally serve the sample webpage

```bash
npm install #if you are on Windows use: npm install --no-bin-links
bower install
grunt uglify
grunt compass
grunt
```

You should be able to see the sample webpage at `http://localhost:3000`.

5 - You can then develop your MP locally and push changes to your Github. When you are ready to host in on the server, you can pull your code from the github repository as you did for MP1.

6 - If you use additional libraries, make sure that all libraries get installed when we do `npm install` and `bower install` after cloning your MP 2 code repo (this can be done by adding the libraries in the `packages.json` or `bower.json` file.
