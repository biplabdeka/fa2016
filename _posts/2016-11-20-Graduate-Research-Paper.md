<span class="section-heading">OVERVIEW</span>

Your goal is to **write a paper comparing three (3) technologies from the same area**. The ultimate motivation for this assignment should be a use case where a web development novice can determine exactly which technology to use for their project by reading your paper.

Below is a list of technologies that you can write about:

<!-- ###Technologies -->

1. Javascript Front End Frameworks
2. NoSQL Databases
3. Backends (Parse, Firebase, etc)
4. Mobile Web Frameworks
5. Real Time Web APIs

For whatever technology you pick, you paper should compare the technologies along multiple dimensions (such as shown below) that makes it easier for a novice to decide what is a good option for their use case.
