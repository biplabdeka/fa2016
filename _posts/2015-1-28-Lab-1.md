1.1: The `mp1_starter` code has changed. Step 14 under Development Environment Setup is new. Step 14 and 15 have changed.


<!-- ###Setting up a Development Environment -->
<span class="section-heading">SETTING UP A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT</span>

In this lab we will set up a development environment for use throughout the class. Our aim is to develop applications in an environment as close as possible to the final server our code is going to be deployed on. Also, having the same development environment for all students in class helps us debug your code faster.

The following has been tested for Mac OS X. We anticipate that steps 1 and 2 might be different for other operating systems. You are responsible for reading the documentation in such cases.

1 - Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

2 - Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

3 -  Clone the [vagrant-dev repository](https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/vagrant-dev.git) from the [class github account](https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/) to your machine. You are encouraged to use the command line for interacting with git and Github. So, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/vagrant-dev.git
```
As an alternative, you can use a graphical client such as the [Github Mac Client](https://mac.github.com/)

4 - Change to the `vagrant-dev` directory and inspect the Vagrantfile. In it we have defined what operating system we want for our virtual machine (Ubuntu in our case) and have also specified what ports of the virtual/guest machine (Ubuntu) should be forwarded to what ports of the host machine (OS X)

```bash
cd vagrant-dev
```

5 - Boot up the virtual machine:

```bash
vagrant up
```
6 - SSH into the virtual machine once it has booted up:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

7 - The `vagrant-dev` folder on your host machine is mounted as `/vagrant` in your guest machine. Change your directory to this folder. This folder remains synced between the two operating systems and is the ideal place to put your projects. That way, you can edit files using the editor on OS X and run them from the terminal in Ubuntu. Now run the `install.sh` script present in that folder.

```bash
cd /vagrant
sudo apt-get install dos2unix **#you can skip this if you are not on a Windows machine**
dos2unix install.sh **#you can skip this if you are not on a Windows machine**
sh install.sh
source ~/.profile
```
 8 - Go to your github account (or create one), and create a new repository named `mp1`. ***Set it to private*** (you'll have to activate the [Github student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to be able to create private repos. The other option is to use [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)). [Create a duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) of the [MP-1 starter code](https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp1_starter) from the class github repo by using the commands below

```bash
git clone --bare https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp1_starter.git
cd mp1_starter.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/your-github-username/mp1.git
# **Mirror-push to your mp1 repository. Use your github username in the URL. Change the URL if you're using bitbucket.**
cd ..
rm -rf mp1_starter.git
```
Then clone it to your machine and inspect the files inside by using the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/mp1
cd mp1
```

10 - Install the NPM packages needed for the project. This reads the `package.json` files and installs the packages in the `node_packages` folder. If you have Windows on your host machine, you need to add the `--no-bin-links` option to this command.

```bash
npm install
```

11 - Install front-end packages (only jQuery in our case) using bower. This reads the `bower.json` files and installs the packages in the `public/lib` folder.

```bash
bower install
```

12 - Now use grunt to compile the scss files located at `source_scss`. The output will be saved in `public/css` folder

```bash
grunt compass
```
13 - Now use grunt to uglify the javascript files located at `source_js`. The output will be saved in `public/js` folder

```bash
grunt uglify
```

14 - Now use grunt to copy HTML files from the `source_html` to the `public` folder

```bash
grunt copy:html

15 - Serve the files using grunt.

```bash
grunt
```
14 - Open your browser and point it to `localhost:3000`. You should see the served webpage there. If you leave grunt running and now make changes to the files in the `source_scss` folder, the `source_js` folder and the `source_html/index.html` file, you will see the webpage reload automatically. This is done through [grunt livereload](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch#optionslivereload). This way you can code away on your code editor while seeing changes in the browser side by side.

15 - Now implement MP1 by writing your code in the `source_scss` folder, the `source_js` folder and the `source_html/index.html` file. Push changes to your `mp1` repo on github.

<span style="color: red"> Warning: </span>  **Do not edit anything under the `public` folder.** All things there are auto-generated and any changes you make there will get overwritten.

16 - You can stop grunt by using `ctrl+c`. You can exit the vagrant guest VM by saying `exit`.

<span class="section-heading">SETTING UP THE SERVER</span>

1 - Get [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) and get the $50 in platform credit for [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

2 - [Create a droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-your-first-digitalocean-droplet-virtual-server) on DigitalOcean with Ubuntu on it and create a new user on it named `vagrant` by following directions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04) (steps 1-3).  You should also setup ssh-keys as recommended in that article (Step 4). More information about setting up ssh keys can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2).

3 - Log in to your server with username `vagrant` and get the install script from our vagrant-dev repo and run it

```bash
ssh vagrant@IP_address_of_server
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/vagrant-dev/master/install.sh
sh install.sh
```

4 - Clone the mp1 repo from your github (make sure you have pushed all changes to it from your development environment). Compile the sass files, uglify the javascript files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/mp1
cd mp1
npm install
bower install
grunt compass
grunt uglify
grunt copy:html
```

5 - Start screen and serve the files by running the expressjs server.

```bash
screen
node app.js
```
6 - The webpage should be up at http://droplet_ip:3000 . Check that in your browser.

7 - Detach from screen and logout

```
ctrl+a followerd by d
exit
```

8 - Keep the server running till MP 1 is graded. To stop the server in the future login to your droplet, reattach to screen and stop the server

```
ssh login_name@droplet_ip  # log back in
screen -r
ctrl+d
exit # exit from screen
exit # exit from server
```

9 - If you want to completely stop your droplet you should take a snapshot of it and then destroy it. You'll be able to create a new droplet from the snapshot image anytime to bring it back online. Otherwise, if you just power it off, your diskspace, CPU, RAM, and IP address are all reserved while your droplet is powered off. So, they will keep charging you for the droplet.
